        <h2>About:</h2>
        
        <p>First of all, cloud computing is a general term for the delivery of hosted services over the internet. The benefits of cloud computing are evident. Pay per use and elasticity are only a select few. Companies can scale up as computing needs increase and scale down again as demands decrease.

       <ul>
           <li>Cloud services that a service provider offers to multiple customers through the internet are reffered to as public cloud services. SaaS, PaaS and IaaS can be said to be providing public cloud-based services. </li>
           <br>
           <li>In contrast, private cloud services are not made available to individual or corporate users/subscribers. Private cloud-based services use technologies associated with public clouds but private cloud run on an organisation's own infrastructure</li>
           <br>
           <li>Cloud services are built, operated and managed by a cloud service provider, which works to ensure end-to-end availability, reliability and security of the cloud.</li>
